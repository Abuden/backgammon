It is a two player game where each player has fifteen checkers which move between twenty-four points according to the roll of two dice, with the objective to be the first to bear off all fifteen of their checkers off the board.
IDE or Text Editors
---
There are many Java IDE or text editors to choose from, ultimately, which to use is subjective, so choose the one that suits you.

Personally, I prefer Eclispse for Java.

- [Downloading and using Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

Running the game
---
*NOTE: The entire repository is based out of the src file of Eclipse, so some code such as loading images have "src/" as part of its path.*

1. Open Eclipse, and create a new Java project.
2. Right click the newly created src folder.
3. Click Import..
4. Click General -> File System -> Next.
5. Click Browse..
6. Browse to the folder that contains all the content of the repository.
7. Select that folder.
8. Tick all the files, i.e. constants, events, game_engine, img, etc.
9. Click Finish.
10. Open and run Main.java.

*NOTE: Make sure the src folder is a type of source folder, not a normal folder in Eclipse.*
